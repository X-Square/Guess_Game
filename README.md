# Guess Game
## Final Project for the online course [The Unix Workbench]
Guess Game is a bash program that allows the user to guess the number of files in the current directory.
When the user enters the correct number, the program will give a congratulation message and stop execution.
Otherwise, it will keep asking for user input until the correct number is entered.


This project applies the following skills taught in [The Unix Workbench]: unix commands and functions, bash programming, make, Markdown, Git and GitHub.
In addition, a simple website about this project is published using GitHub Pages. The website can be found [here](http://xiaoxuanswang.com/Guess_Game/).
